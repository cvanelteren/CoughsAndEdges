You’ve reached the  landing page for the  RIVM Summer School
2024 on  Complex Systems Modeling. This  session is designed
to introduce you to the fascinating world of complex systems
modeling. Aimed  at beginners  to intermediate  learners, we
will   guide  you   through  implementing,   analyzing,  and
enhancing a complex system.

Our approach is hands-on, so be  prepared to dive in and get
your hands dirty. By the end of the session, you will have:

-   Implemented an SIR model
-   Added edge dynamics to the model
-   Conducted some preliminary analyses

Check out  the detailed schedule  below to see what  we have
planned.  We  look  forward  to a  productive  and  engaging
session with you!

# Workshop Outline


<a id="org223bd63"></a>

## Welcome and Overview

-   Greeting: Welcome to the workshop! We’re excited to dive into the SIR model with edge dynamics together.
-   Session Goals: Our aim is to build and analyze an SIR model enhanced with edge dynamics. Here’s how we’ll break down our time:
    -   Part 1: Implementing the SIR model [1 hour]
    -   Part 2: Adding edge dynamics [1 hour]
    -   Part 3: Analyzing the model and discussing insights [45 minutes]
-   Breaks: We’ll take two 15-minute breaks to keep our energy up and ensure we have ample time to reflect and discuss.

Feel free to  ask questions at any point.  Let’s get started
and  explore  the  dynamics  of  the  SIR  model  with  edge
dynamics!

# Part 1: Setting Up the Base Implementation

-   Environment Setup and Model Overview [15 min]
    -   **Environment  Preparation**: We’ll  start by  setting up
        the  necessary environment.  A Git  repository will  be
        provided   with   all   the   required   packages   and
        dependencies.
    -   **SIR Model  Background**: I’ll give a  brief overview of
        the   SIR   (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)   model,
        explaining   its  purpose   and   how   it’s  used   in
        epidemiological modeling.
-   Hands-On Coding [45 min]
    -   **Activity**:  You’ll begin  implementing the  base SIR
        model. This will involve writing code to simulate the
        spread  of  an  infectious   disease  using  the  SIR
        framework.
    -   **Support**:  I’ll  be  available to  assist  with  any
        questions or  issues you might encounter  during this
        coding session.
-   Break [15 min]
    
    -   **Purpose**: Take a short break to refresh
    
    and discuss any immediate questions or thoughts about the
    first part of the session.

# Part 2: Adding Edge Dynamics

-   Introduction   to   Edge   Dynamics  [15   min]
    -   **Concept Explanation**: We’ll discuss what edge dynamics
        are and why they are  important in enhancing our model.
        Edge  dynamics  consider  how the  connections  between
        nodes in our model might change over time.
-   Coding  Edge Dynamics  [45 min]
    -   **Activity**:  You’ll extend  your initial  SIR model  by
        incorporating   edge   dynamics.  This   will   involve
        modifying the  code to  reflect changes in  the network
        structure  and  how  they  impact  the  spread  of  the
        disease. Guidance:  I’ll guide you through  the process
        and provide support as needed  to ensure you’re able to
        successfully integrate edge dynamics into your model.
-   Break [15 min]
    
    -   **Purpose**: Take another break to relax, ask
    
    questions, or discuss what we’ve covered so far.

# Part 3: Complex Analyses and Wrap-Up


<a id="org3bdfe16"></a>

## Modeling Pitfalls [15 min]

Challenges: We’ll discuss common  pitfalls and challenges in
modeling  complex systems.  Understanding these  issues will
help  you avoid  common  mistakes and  improve your  model’s
accuracy.


<a id="orgc9c365f"></a>

## Analysis of the Adaptive Model [15 min]

Analytical Techniques:  Explore different types  of analyses
that can be  performed on our enhanced  model. We’ll discuss
how to interpret the results and what insights can be gained
from the model.

# Key Takeaways [15 min]

-   **Simplification  Strategy**:  Emphasize the  importance  of
    starting with  a simple  model and adding  complexity only
    when necessary.
-   **Troubleshooting**: If you  encounter difficulties, attempt
    to simplify the model to better understand the issues.
-   **Understanding**: Ensure  you fully understand  the current
    model before proceeding. Make  sure that the added details
    are necessary and useful for your analysis.
